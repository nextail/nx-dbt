# ðŸ¥ª Nextail's Costs dbt Project

This project is based on the [dbt Labs' Jaffle Shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle-shop) that serves as a template for creating a custom dbt project. You may find certain configurations that are related to this Jaffle Shop, but should not be required when running this project at Nextail.

This project started as a sandbox project for exploring how to create a simple ELT pipeline to ingest costs-related information at Nextail, and show the results in a dashboard. For further details, please refer to the [ðŸ“š README.md](https://github.com/nextail/nx-dbt/blob/sandbox/docs/README.md) file.
