## 1. Requirements

- Docker
- Python â‰¥3.9
- [PDM](https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/#installation): using containerization, installing pdm locally is not necessary.(https://pdm.fming.dev/latest/usage/hooks/#dependencies-management)

## 2. Scenarios

1. Development
2. Cloud
### 2.1. Development

Include:
- Postgres 11
- Dagster Daemon
- Dagit

Dagster Daemon and Dagit have `dagster` folder as a docker volume.

The folder `dagster/src/` contains the code for your Dagster repository. A repository is a collection of software-defined assets, jobs, schedules, and sensors. Repositories are loaded as a unit by the Dagster CLI, Dagit and the Dagster Daemon. he repository specifies a list of items, each of which can be a AssetsDefinition, JobDefinition, ScheduleDefinition, or SensorDefinition. If you include a schedule or sensor, the job it targets will be automatically also included on the repository.

To start the development environment:
```bash
make start-dev
```

Navigate to http://127.0.0.0:3000 in your web browser.
Go to Launchpad tab. On this tab you will be able to edit job configuration. 
On the bottom right it is the "Lunch Run" execution button.

```bash
make test
```

As you create Dagster ops and graphs, add tests in `dagster/tests/` to check that your
code behaves as desired and does not break over time.

For hints on how to write tests for ops and graphs,
[see the documentation tutorial of Testing in Dagster](https://docs.dagster.io/tutorial/testable).
### 2.2. Cloud
